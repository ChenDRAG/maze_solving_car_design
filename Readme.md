# Introduction
This is my first arduino project on my first year in Tsinghua University. It's basically a mazing solving car (for any maze you want) based on flooding algorithm.
# Explanation
In each folder is a different software version. The car will draw a map of the maze on pc through bluetooth communication.
-SpecialCar3floods               deals only with maze in square shape
-SpecialCar4malloc              deals with maze in any irregular shape
-SpecialCar7malloc2esay      uses 2 uno board to control the car collaborately  because of limited memory
